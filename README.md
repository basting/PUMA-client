# PUMA-client
Pressure Ulcer Management Application (PUMA) client


The client application, which is developed in Android 5 (Lollypop), will be used by the remote patient or the remote health service provider who is attending to the patient. 

The primary functionality is to capture the pressure ulcer image along with other important information related to the pressure ulcer. This is sent across to the application server which stores it in the database. The client application invokes the REST APIs deployed on the application server to pass on the information.
